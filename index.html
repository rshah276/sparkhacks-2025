        <p class="website-description"> As the e-commerce space gets clouded by drop shippers and other large corporations, it's important for creaters and curators
            to have a physical space to vend directly to their communities. Pop-Up Connect is a space for cafe, store, and other 
            businesses to share vendor fair opportunities with other small businesses. Businesses will share how many tables they're offering 
            and other details about their space, and artists selling crochet work, jewelry, or even vintage resellers, can contact 
            them to join the fair. For the cafes, business will continue as usual -- with some traffic from the vendors' friends who wouldn't
            have visited the cafe otherwise.
